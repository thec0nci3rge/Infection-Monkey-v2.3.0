## What is Guardicore Infection Monkey?
Infection Monkey is an open-source adversary emulation platform that helps you
improve your security posture using empirical data. The Monkey uses various
methods to self-propagate across a network and reports its activities to a
centralized command and control server known as the Monkey Island. üêµüèùÔ∏è You
know, like malware, but ‚ú®safe.‚ú®

## How does it work?

Infection Monkey is comprised of two components:

* **Agent** - A configurable network worm that can infect machines, steal
  data, and deliver payloads.
* **Monkey Island** - A command and control server used to control and
  visualize Infection Monkey's progress throughout the simulation.

### Build up your malware antibodies üíâ

![Malware Vaccine](/images/monkey-iv.png "Malware Vaccine")

You can think of Infection Monkey as a kind of "malware vaccine." Prior to the
invention of mRNA vaccines, biological vaccines worked as follows:

1. Collect a sample of the virus.
2. Through the magic of chemistry, create a weakened or inert form of the
   virus.
3. Inject the weakened virus into the human body, allowing the immune system to
   build up a defense.

Once the immune system has built up a defense, it can recognize and fight off
the real pathogen if it should ever infect the body.

**Infection Monkey aims to use this same approach to combat computer viruses
(or other types of malware.)**

1. Collect a sample of the malware.
2. Analyze the malware and understand its behaviors.
3. Modify Infection Monkey's configuration to enable behaviors that closely
   mimic those of the malware, but without causing damage to the target
   systems.
4. Inject the Monkey Agent into the network and validate (empirically) that
   your security controls can detect, prevent, or otherwise mitigate the
   infection.
5. If the infection is not successfully thwarted, take the necessary steps to
   "build up your immune response" by improving your security tools, policies,
   and processes.

Sun Tzu said, "if you know others and know yourself, you will not be imperiled
in a hundred battles." Knowledge of both your adversary's tactics and your own
defensive capabilities is necessary in order to successfully secure a network.
Infection Monkey aims helps you to know both.

## Results

The results of running Monkey Agents are:
 - A map which displays how much of the network an attacker can see, what
   services are accessible and potential propagation routes.
 - A report, which displays security issues that Monkey Agents
   discovered and/or exploited.

A more in-depth description of reports generated can be found in the
[reports documentation page.](/features/reports)
