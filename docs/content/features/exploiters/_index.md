# Exploiters

Exploiters are Infection Monkey plugins that attempt to infect machines
throughout the network by spreading copies of the Agent.

## Mimicking attackers

During the propagation phase of an attack, attackers exploit the
vulnerabilities that were identified in the reconnaissance phase to compromise
networked systems. By exploiting the identified vulnerabilities, attackers are
able to gain unauthorized access to systems, escalate privileges, or execute
malicious actions.

## How exploiters work

After the Infection Monkey Agent completes the reconnaissance phase, it begins
the propagation phase. In this phase, the Agent attempts to spread itself to
as many systems on the network as possible. It does this by using the enabled
exploiters to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a vulnerable system; this
step is known as "exploitation". After exploitation, the Agent completes the
propagation phase by copying itself to the compromised system and launching a
new Agent process.

Infection Monkey has several exploiters that mimic real-world attack vectors.
Some exploiters are based on vulnerabilities while others use brute-force
tactics to gain access. The majority of exploiters pose little or no risk to
the performance or availability of targeted systems. Exploiters that are known
to adversely impact production workloads are clearly marked as "unsafe" in the
Monkey Island.
